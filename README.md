## Boardgamegeek analysis
[Boardgamegeek](https://www.boardgamegeek.com) is a great site to look for boardgames.
I've downloaded 15 million reviews from BGG though the API. Here is what I did with it:
1. Made it into a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jvanelteren/boardgamegeek-reviews)
2. Did data-analysis, also published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jvanelteren/exploring-the-13m-reviews-bgg-dataset)
3. Tried collaborative filtering with FastAI, basically trying to build a recommendation engine like Netflix. Result [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jvanelteren/collaborative-filtering-defining-similar-games)
4. Converted it into an webapp https://bgg.onrender.com/. The webapp is no longer live
